    "Q1. What is the difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding? Provide an example of when you \n",
    "might choose one over the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are both techniques used to convert categorical variables into numerical form for machine learning algorithms. However, they differ in their application and suitability for certain types of categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding is used when the categorical variable has an inherent order or rank among its categories. The categories are mapped to integer values based on their natural ordering, preserving the ordinal relationship between them. This technique is appropriate when the categorical variable has a clear ranking or hierarchy.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Consider a dataset containing a categorical variable \"Education Level\" with categories \"High School,\" \"Bachelor's Degree,\" \"Master's Degree,\" and \"Ph.D.\" We can assign integer values 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, to represent the increasing educational attainment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding:\n",
    "Label Encoding is used for categorical variables with no intrinsic order. Each unique category is assigned a unique integer value, essentially converting the categories into numerical form. This technique is suitable when there is no natural order or rank among the categories, and they are treated as nominal data.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Let's say you have a categorical variable \"City\" with categories \"New York,\" \"Los Angeles,\" and \"Chicago.\" In Label Encoding, you can assign them integer values like 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to choose one over the other:\n",
    "You would choose Ordinal Encoding when there is a meaningful order or hierarchy among the categories. For example, when dealing with survey responses like \"Poor,\" \"Fair,\" \"Good,\" and \"Excellent,\" Ordinal Encoding is appropriate because these responses have a natural order.\n",
    "\n",
    "You would choose Label Encoding when there is no inherent order among the categories, and they are merely nominal values. In such cases, using Ordinal Encoding might lead to incorrect interpretations as it could introduce a false sense of order.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, use Ordinal Encoding for categorical variables with inherent order or rank, and use Label Encoding for categorical variables with no natural ordering or when dealing with nominal data.\n"

    "Q2. Explain how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works and provide an example of when you might use it in \n",
    "a machine learning project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding, also known as Mean Encoding or Likelihood Encoding, is a feature engineering technique used to encode categorical variables based on the target variable in a supervised machine learning project. The main idea behind this method is to replace each category of the categorical variable with the mean (or some other measure) of the target variable for that category. This helps the model capture the relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps to perform Target Guided Ordinal Encoding are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Group the dataset by the categorical variable.\n",
    "Calculate the mean (or other desired measure) of the target variable for each category.\n",
    "Replace the categories with their corresponding mean values in the original dataset.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a dataset of employees in a company with two features: \"Department\" (categorical) and \"Salary\" (numerical, the target variable). We want to predict employee salaries based on their department. Here's a snippet of the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Employee ID              Department             Salary\n",
    "    1                         HR                50000\n",
    "    2                         IT                60000\n",
    "    3                         IT                55000\n",
    "    4                         Sales             48000\n",
    "    5                         HR                52000\n",
    "To perform Target Guided Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the mean salary for each department:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean Salary for HR = (50000 + 52000) / 2 = 51000\n",
    "Mean Salary for IT = (60000 + 55000) / 2 = 57500\n",
    "Mean Salary for Sales = 48000\n",
    "Replace the \"Department\" categories with their corresponding mean salary values:\n",
    "\n",
    "HR -> 51000\n",
    "IT -> 57500\n",
    "Sales -> 48000\n",
    "Now, the dataset with the encoded \"Department\" feature looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Employee ID                 Department        Salary\n",
    "    1                         51000           50000\n",
    "    2                         57500           60000\n",
    "    3                         57500           55000\n",
    "    4                         48000           48000\n",
    "    5                         51000           52000\n",
    "When to use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding can be beneficial when dealing with categorical variables that exhibit a strong relationship with the target variable.\n",
    "For example, in the employee salary prediction scenario, the department could be a critical factor influencing salaries. Using Target Guided Ordinal Encoding, the model can learn the average salary associated with each department, which may help improve its predictive performance when handling new data with similar department categories. However, it's essential to be cautious about overfitting, and cross-validation or regularization techniques should be used to avoid potential issues.\n",
